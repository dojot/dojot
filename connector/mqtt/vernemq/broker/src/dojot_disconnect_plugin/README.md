# Dojot Disconnect Plugin

This plugin disconnects clients from VerneMQ after some time. This increases the security because
the client's certificate might've been revoked/expired and we wouldn't know it, since these checks
are made in the beginning of the TLS handshake.

The disconnection time can be changed by passing the time in milisseconds to the
`PLUGIN_DISC_LIFETIME_SESSION` environment variable.

The most important files are:

- [src/utils.erl](./src/utils.erl)
- [src/dojot_disconnect_plugin.app.src](./src/dojot_disconnect_plugin.app.src)

__IMPORTANT__: make sure you use the same Erlang version that the
[Dojot's VerneMQ Dockerfile](../../Dockerfile) uses to avoid problems.

For more info on plugin development for VerneMQ, please refer to the
[official documentation](https://docs.vernemq.com/plugindevelopment/introduction).

# Configuration

Key                          | Purpose          | Default Value    | Accepted values

PLUGIN_DISC_LIFETIME_SESSION | Session lifetime | 1800000 (30 min) | integer (miliseconds)

# Running the plugin in VerneMQ

Build VerneMQ image:

```shell
cd ../..
docker build <image_name>:<tag>
cd -
```

__NOTE THAT__ if you are not running a local VerneMQ instance, you should send the image to the
machine that is running or use some kind of Docker Registry (e.g. DockerHub).

After initializing this newly-made VerneMQ image, enter in it and enable the plugin:

```shell
vmq-admin plugin enable --name dojot_disconnect_plugin --path <PathToYourPlugin>/dojot_disconnect_plugin/_build/default
```

Depending on how VerneMQ is started you might need ``sudo`` rights to access ``vmq-admin``.
Moreover the ``<PathToYourPlugin>`` should be accessible by VerneMQ (file permissions).
