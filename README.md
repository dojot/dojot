# dojot 

dojot is an open source platform created with the goal to develop basic technologies for
smart cities. At first this platform is focused on easing integration of applications
related to public safety, urban mobility and public health care - and aims to inspire a
multi-disciplinary community and ecosystem around those goals.

## Help us make dojot better

Given the platform multi-faceted implementation and its micro service architecture, there are
multiple repositories hosted at github to keep track of each of its services. To ease the
management of features and communication with the community, this repository is used as a hub
for feature requests and issue reporting, leaving the hassle of issue interpretation away from
our end users.

This repository is supposed to be empty. Please do not send any code updates to it.

To report any issues, bugs, wanted features or get help from the development team please open
up an issue in this repository, and the dev team will reply accordingly.
