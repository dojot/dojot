dojot was conceived with the goal of developing and demonstrating technologies for smart cities. Initially focusing on the pillars of public safety, urban mobility and health. It intends to build a multidisciplinary ecosystem in these areas.

dojot is a Brazilian IoT Platform that came up with an open source proposal in order to facilitate the development of solutions and the IoT ecosystem with local content focused on Brazilian needs.

The platform is one of the outcomes of the project "Plataforma Aberta para IoT e suas Aplicações", which is supported by FUNTTEL via [Finep](http://www.finep.gov.br/), and led  by [CPqD](https://www.cpqd.com.br/en/), its main executor, in partnership with other science and technology institutions: [Instituto Atlântico](http://www.atlantico.com.br/?lang=en), [Centro de Tecnologia da Informação Renato Archer - CTI](https://www.cti.gov.br/en), and [Fundação de Apoio à Capacitação em Tecnologia da Informação - FACTI](https://facti.com.br/).

## dojot Manifesto

dojot is a derivation of dojo (or dôjo), a Japanese word that, basically, means "the place where Japanese martial arts are trained".

Dojo is not just a simple training area, it is also a place to be respected as the practitioners' home. Therefore, culturally, it is very common to see the practitioner bowing before entering this area, just as they do before entering their homes.

Linking this concept to the digital world and applying it to software development, dojo represents the place of a developer meeting, seeking for good practices and absorbing the vision of software development as an art.

By combining this concept with the Internet of Things, we pursue IoT software development best practices, bringing together multidisciplinary experts to accelerate solution delivery and reduce the risks inherent in innovation.

> **dojot** = dojô, IoT, and connectivity.

## Repository Overview

dojot follows a microservice architecture, and until the caratê release, each microservice had been kept in its own repository. In order to make easier the management and versioning of the microservices; from defendu release (planned for the first half of 2020) onwards we will keep all the microservices in this single repository.

> Work in progress!

## Quick Start
