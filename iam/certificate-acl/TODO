1) The x.509 service doesn't persist the applications' certificates, so there is
   no event for deleting them.  Considering that an application is associated with
   a single certificate, the ACL service must check if an entry exists for an
   application before adding a new one and remove it. The ACL service can use
   an auxiliary table in REDIS (DB 1) which associates the application with its
   certificate (application -> fingerprint). So, if an entry exists in DB 1 the
   corresponding entry in DB 0 must be removed before adding the new one.

2) Analyse if worths to expire the devices' entries so that Redis works as a cache.
