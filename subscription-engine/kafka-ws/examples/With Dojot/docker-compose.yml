    ## Change to your Dojot environment
    # environment:
      # KAFKAWS_DOJOT_ADDRESS: "localhost:3000"
      # KAFKAWS_DOJOT_USER: "admin"
      # KAFKAWS_DOJOT_PASSWORD: "admin"

      ## You can change here these variables to test with other topics and filters
      # Don't forget that the Dojot user must have access to the topic
      # KAFKAWS_APP_KAFKA_TOPIC: "admin.device-data"

      ## The filters are, by default, empty. If you want to change this, here are some examples:
      # Ex. 1
      # KAFKAWS_APP_FILTER_FIELDS: "fields=sensor/status,temperature"
      # KAFKAWS_APP_FILTER_WHERE: "where=sensor.status=in:failed,stopped;"
      # Ex. 2
      # KAFKAWS_APP_FILTER_FIELDS: "fields=location"
      # KAFKAWS_APP_FILTER_WHERE: "where=temperature=gte:20;"

      ## If the Kafka WS server has HTTPS, add this:
      # KAFKAWS_TLS_ENABLE: "true"
      # If enabled, you need the CA file too:
      # KAFKAWS_TLS_CA_FILE: "./certs/ca-cert.pem"
    restart: always
    command: ["node", "Client.js"]
    logging:
      driver: json-file
      options:
        max-size: 100m
    # If you have activated the TLS, you need to pass the CA certificate in a volume. Example:
    # volumes:
    #   - ./certs/client/:/certs/:Z
