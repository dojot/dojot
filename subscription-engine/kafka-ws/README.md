# Development in VS Code

If you use VS Code, you can install the [Remote Container](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) plugin and use the provided container to code in a standardized environment.

After installing the plugin, open the directory which contains this code with VS Code. It will ask you whether you want to use the container.
