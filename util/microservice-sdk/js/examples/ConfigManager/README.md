# Config Manager

This example shows how to use the Config Manager. You can activate/deactivate some environment
variables in the [sample file](sample.js). You can also create some of them by hand:
```shell
export K2V_APP_PARAM="myNewParam"
```

To run it, simply install the dependencies:
```shell
npm i
```

And run:

```shell
npm run
```
