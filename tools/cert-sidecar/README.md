# **Cert-Sidecar**

The **Cert-Sidecar**, certificate sidecar, is a service utility for managing [x509-identity-mgmt](../../x509-identity-mgmt) certificates for use with TLS connections.

__NOTE THAT__ In Kubernetes, a pod is a group of one or more containers with shared storage and network. A sidecar is a utility container in a pod thatâ€™s loosely coupled to the main application container.

## **Overview**

The **Cert-Sidecar** generates a set of files to help configure a service to use TLS and can be used by sharing volumes (folder/files) between services/containers.

One of the things that **Cert-Sidecar** does is generate a key pair and then a CSR (Certificate Signing Request), which can look like a *certification intent*. Then **Cert-Sidecar** sends this CSR to *x509-identity-mgmt* to obtain a public certificate. In addition, **Cert-Sidecar** retrieves the root certificate from the CA and the CRL (certificate revocation lists) from *x509-identity-mgmt*.See the diagram below:

<img src="./docs/diagrams/diagram.png">
</p>

Another important point in **Cert-Sidecar** is to guarantee the validity of the current public certificate and the root certificate of the CA, in each of the configured times the **Cert-Sidecar** will verify:

- whether the certificates are about to expire based on a configured time and retrieve new certificates if it makes sense;
- if the certificate has been revoked, listed on the CRL, and retrieve new certificates, if it makes sense.

In addition, to ensure that the CRL (Certificate Revocation Lists) is always updated, every time in the configured time, **Cert-Sidecar** will check if there is a new CRL and update it if different.

In the end, we can say that **Cert-Sidecar** creates four files in the *PEM* format: a *Private key*, *Public certificate*, *CA certificate* and *CRL*.

__ATTENTION__ When the service is unable to retrieve a CRL or update certificates if they have been revoked or expired, after several defined attempts using the Exponential Backoff strategy the service will terminate and delete all files. And at each configured time, the service checks if it can connect with *x509-identity-mgmt* and if it does not, the service changes to unhealthy. For more information about that, check the [__Service State Manager__ ](https://github.com/dojot/dojot-microservice-sdk-js/blob/master/lib/serviceStateManager/README.md) module in our [Microservice SDK](https://github.com/dojot/dojot-microservice-sdk-js).

There is a examples of how to use  **Cert-Sidecar** with kubernetes and docker-compose within the directory [examples](./examples).

## Dependencies

## Running the service

### Configuration

Before running the **Cert-Sidecar** service within your environment, make sure you configure the variables to match your needs.

You can select the configuration file via the `CERT_SC_USER_CONFIG_FILE` variable. Its default value is `production.conf`. Check the [config directory](./config) for the user configurations that are available by default.

For more information about the usage of the configuration files and environment variables, check the
__ConfigManager__ module in our [Microservice SDK](https://github.com/dojot/dojot-microservice-sdk-js).
You can also check the [ConfigManager environment variables documentation](https://github.com/dojot/dojot-microservice-sdk-js/blob/master/lib/configManager/README.md#environment-variables) for more details.

You can either use environment variables or configuration files to change their values.

## How to run

Beforehand, you need an already running dojot instance in your machine. Check out the
[dojot documentation](https://dojotdocs.readthedocs.io)
for more information on installation methods.

Generate the Docker image:

```shell
docker build -t <username>/cert-sidecar:<tag> -f  .
```

Then the image tagged a `<username>/cert-sidecar:<tag>` will be made available. You can send it to
your DockerHub registry to made it available for non-local dojot installations:

```shell
docker push <username>/cert-sidecar:<tag>
```

__NOTE THAT__  you can use the official image provided by dojot in its  [DockerHub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/dojot/cert-sidecar).
